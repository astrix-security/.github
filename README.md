# [cite_start]AI Agent Security [cite: 19]

### [cite_start]Discover, secure, and deploy AI agents responsibly across the enterprise. [cite: 20]

---

[cite_start]Astrix protects enterprises from their fastest-growing blindspot ‚Äî AI agents and Non-Human Identities (NHIs) that outnumber employees 100:1 and fall outside traditional IAM[cite: 22]. [cite_start]Our platform enables enterprises to discover every AI agent and NHI, secure excessive privileges and real-time threats, and deploy agentic AI safely with secure-by-design guardrails like just-in-time access[cite: 23]. [cite_start]This allows organizations to adopt AI securely and at scale[cite: 23].

## Key Capabilities

### Discover: AI Agent Visibility and Context
* [cite_start]**Complete Inventory**: Get a continuous, real-time inventory of all AI agents (custom, third-party, or shadow), non-human identities, and secrets across cloud, SaaS, and on‚Äëprem environments[cite: 75].
* [cite_start]**Deep Context**: Our Identity Graph visualizes relationships between AI agents, NHIs, secrets, permissions, owners, and accessed resources[cite: 75].
* [cite_start]**Risk Prioritization**: Focus remediation with automated risk scoring, powered by contextual insights on access, usage, permissions, ownership, and security findings[cite: 75].

### Secure: Proactive Posture and Threat Detection
* [cite_start]**Posture Management**: Reduce the agentic attack surface by addressing excessive privileges, configuration issues, and automatically assigning human ownership to every agent[cite: 77].
* [cite_start]**Threat Detection**: Rapidly identify suspicious activity across AI agents and NHIs, including unusual patterns, unauthorized actions, and compromised identities[cite: 77].
* [cite_start]**Automated Remediation**: Automate remediation workflows without breaking AI agent functionality and integrate seamlessly with your ITSM, SIEM, and SOAR tools[cite: 77].

### Deploy: Secure-by-Design Agentic AI
* [cite_start]**Secure Access for AI Agents**: Enforce policy with just-in-time provisioning and least-privilege credentials for every agent[cite: 79].
* [cite_start]**Lifecycle Governance**: Apply policy as agents are deployed to establish clear ownership and automate attestation[cite: 79].
* [cite_start]**Developer Speed Without Risk**: Let developers spin up agents fast with policy-driven, pre-approved access, cutting escalations and keeping work moving[cite: 79].
