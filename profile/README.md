# AI Agent Security

### Discover, secure, and deploy AI agents responsibly across the enterprise.

---

Astrix protects enterprises from their fastest-growing blind spot — **AI agents and Non-Human Identities (NHIs)** that outnumber employees 100:1 and fall outside traditional IAM.  

Our platform enables enterprises to discover every AI agent and NHI, secure excessive privileges and real-time threats, and deploy agentic AI safely with secure-by-design guardrails like just-in-time access.  
This allows organizations to adopt AI securely and at scale.

**Trusted by leading enterprises including Workday, NetApp, Priceline, Figma, Hubspot, and Workato.**
