# AI Agent Security

### Discover, secure, and deploy AI agents responsibly across the enterprise.

---

Astrix protects enterprises from their fastest-growing blind spot — **AI agents and Non-Human Identities (NHIs)** that outnumber employees 100:1 and fall outside traditional IAM.  
Our platform enables enterprises to discover every AI agent and NHI, secure excessive privileges and real-time threats, and deploy agentic AI safely with secure-by-design guardrails like just-in-time access.  
This allows organizations to adopt AI securely and at scale.

**Trusted by leading enterprises including Workday, NetApp, Priceline, Figma, Hubspot, and Workato.**

## Key Capabilities

### Discover: AI Agent Visibility and Context
* **Complete Inventory** – Continuous, real-time inventory of all AI agents (custom, third-party, or shadow), NHIs, and secrets across cloud, SaaS, and on-prem environments.  
* **Deep Context** – Visualize relationships between AI agents, NHIs, secrets, permissions, owners, and accessed resources.  
* **Risk Prioritization** – Focus remediation with automated risk scoring based on contextual insights about access, usage, and security findings.

### Secure: Proactive Posture and Threat Detection
* **Posture Management** – Reduce the agentic attack surface by addressing excessive privileges, configuration issues, and automatically assigning ownership.  
* **Threat Detection** – Identify suspicious activity across AI agents and NHIs, including unauthorized actions and compromised identities.  
* **Automated Remediation** – Automate workflows without breaking AI agent functionality and integrate with your ITSM, SIEM, and SOAR tools.

### Deploy: Secure-by-Design Agentic AI
* **Secure Access for AI Agents** – Enforce just-in-time provisioning and least-privilege credentials for every agent.
